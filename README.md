# Artifice Tweaks

A small mod for reverting most gameplay-related changes back to v56 version of Artifice and interior weight tweaking for the moon.

# Changes

- Scrap count range is reverted from `26-30` to `30-37` (v56).
- Interior size multiplier is reverted from `1.8` to `2.0` (v56).
- Interior weights are adjusted to `50%`, `25%`, `25%` for `Mansion`, `Factory` and `Mineshaft` respectively.
